## System for remote management and monitoring of the laboratory

This is my engineering thesis for AGH University of Science and Technology. It allows users to book a room in AGH campus. Before this project, AGH employees comunicated through an e-mail. It was not very effective, so I decided to do a project about it :).

One of functions of this project is importing a schedule of your classes to this system, so it automatically reserves all dates that are in the schedule.
